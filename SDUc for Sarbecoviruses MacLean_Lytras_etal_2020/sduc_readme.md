##SDUc for Sarbecoviruses

This folder contains python scripts used for calculating the newly developed corrected Synonymous Dinucleotide Usage (SDUc),
applied to a set of 69 viruses of the _Sarbecoviruses_ subgenus of the _Coronaviridae_ family. 

The metric is described in the preprint *Evidence of significant natural selection in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, not humans* [(MacLean, Lytras et al., 2020)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.122366v1.article-metrics)

This updated version of the SDU will soon be added to the DinuQ python package.

The usage of the scripts is described in the schematic below:
